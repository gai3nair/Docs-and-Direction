    <p><strong>Welcome!</strong> This is a digital log of my journey as a technical writer who never stopped writing, even after stepping into leadership. 
    If you believe that writing can lead and leadership can be empathetic, you‚Äôll feel right at home here.</p>

    <p>I am a Technical Writing professional with over 20 years of experience, including a decade in leadership roles. 
    I have worked with organizations such as Verizon, CA Technologies, Xerox, FIS, and Arcserve, leading documentation projects from start to finish and mentoring teams to do their best work.</p>

        <p>
          Hello! I am a Senior Manager in Technical Writing who still writes, not because I have to, 
          but because I genuinely enjoy the craft. Docs and Direction is my space to share what I have 
          learned from more than twenty years in documentation, including over a decade in leadership.
        </p>

        <p>
          My career has taken me through organizations such as Verizon, CA Technologies, Xerox, FIS, 
          and Arcserve. Over the years, I have simplified complex technologies, designed documentation 
          strategies, mentored global teams, and collaborated closely with product, engineering, UX, 
          and business leaders.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe that the best leaders never step away from the work that shaped them. For me, that 
          means staying connected to writing, tools, processes, and the people who make documentation 
          meaningful. Direction is not only about strategy. It is about clarity, empathy, and choosing 
          the right words for the right moment.
        </p>

        <p>
          My strengths include diligence, resilience, and people-first leadership. I enjoy building 
          teams, uplifting writers, and shaping content programs that support both product needs and 
          user expectations. If you are here for insights, practical advice, or simply to share in 
          the journey, welcome aboard.
        </p>

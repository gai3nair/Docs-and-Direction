    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am a Senior Manager in Technical Writing who still writes, not because I have to, but because I love it.</p>

    <p><strong>Docs and Direction</strong> is my space to share what I have learned from over 20 years in documentation, including more than a decade in leadership. My career has taken me through roles at organizations such as Verizon, CA Technologies, Xerox, FIS, and Arcserve, where I worked on simplifying complex technologies, designing documentation strategies, mentoring teams, and collaborating with product leaders.</p>

    <p>I believe the best leaders never let go of the craft that got them there. For me, that means staying close to the writing, the tools, and the people who make it all happen. Direction is not just about strategy. It is about clarity, empathy, and choosing the right words for the right moment.</p>

    <p>If you are here for insights, practical advice, or simply to share in the journey, welcome aboard.</p>

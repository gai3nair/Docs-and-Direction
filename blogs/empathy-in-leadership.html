      <!-- Article body -->
      <p>In a quiet village, there were two potters. Both crafted beautiful pots, but only one had a long line of customers. When asked why, he said, “I listen to what they need. Some want a pot to hold rice, some want it for flowers, others for water. Clay bends easily when you understand its purpose.”</p>

      <p>Leadership is a lot like pottery. People respond to how they are treated. Too much pressure and they crack; too little and they lose shape. Empathy helps a leader find the right balance.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Leadership is not about being in charge. It is about taking care of those in your charge.”
        <br>— Simon Sinek
      </blockquote>

      <h2>What Empathy Looks Like at Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Listening beyond status updates:</strong> noticing silence and drawing out concerns.</li>
        <li><strong>Designing for constraints:</strong> workload, time zones, and energy levels matter.</li>
        <li><strong>Making decisions visible:</strong> explain the “why” and close the loop.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practices You Can Start Today</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Open with purpose:</strong> state the outcome and who it helps.</li>
        <li><strong>Invite dissent:</strong> ask, “What might we be missing?”</li>
        <li><strong>Share credit, own gaps:</strong> celebrate the team; take responsibility for misses.</li>
      </ol>
